# google-abook

`google-abook` is a small script to convert a Google Contacts CSV into the `abook` format.

## Usage

    $ python -m google-abook <google.csv>

then look at your beautifully imported contacts with `abook`.

## Motivation

I wanted to use abook with my Google Contacts, but it didn't look like there was a way to convert.
